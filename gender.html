<h2>Female</h2>

    <p>Female (symbol: ♀) is the sex of an organism that produces non-mobile ova (egg cells),
      the type of gamete that fuses with the male gamete during sexual reproduction.
Most female mammals, including female humans, have two X chromosomes. Female characteristics vary between
different species with some species having pronounced female characteristics, such as the presence of
pronounced mammary glands in mammals. There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different
species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary
lineages.
The word female comes from the Latin femella, the diminutive form of femina, meaning "woman";
it is not etymologically related to the word male. Female can also be used to refer to gender.</p>
<h3>Defining characteristics</h3>
<p>Females produce ova, the larger gametes in a heterogamous reproduction system, while the smaller and usually motile gametes, the spermatozoa, are produced by males.A female cannot reproduce sexually without access to the gametes of a male, and vice versa, but in some species females can reproduce by themselves asexually, for example via parthenogenesis.

There is no single genetic mechanism behind sex differences in different species and the existence of two sexes seems to have evolved multiple times independently in different evolutionary lineages. Patterns of sexual reproduction include:

Isogamous species with two or more mating types with gametes of identical form and behavior (but different at the molecular level),
Anisogamous species with gametes of male and female types,
Oogamous species, which include humans, in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move. Oogamy is a form of anisogamy. There is an argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction.
Other than the defining difference in the type of gamete produced, differences between males and females in one lineage cannot always be predicted by differences in another. The concept is not limited to animals; egg cells are produced by chytrids, diatoms, water moulds and land plants, among others. In land plants, female and male designate not only the egg- and sperm-producing organisms and structures, but also the structures of the sporophytes that give rise to male and female plants.[citation needed]<img src="마네킹.jpg" alt="mannequin" width="100%"></p>
