<h2>Queen</h2>

    <p><Strong style="font-size:20px">A queen </strong> regnant (plural: queens regnant) is a female monarch, equivalent in rank and title to a king, who reigns
     in her own right over a realm known as a "<strong>kingdom</strong>"; as opposed to a queen consort, who is the wife of a reigning
     king; or a queen regent, who is the guardian of a child monarch and rules temporarily in the child's stead,
      be it de jure in sharing power, or de facto in ruling alone. A princess regnant is a female monarch who
      reigns in her own right over a "<strong>principality</strong>"; an empress regnant is a female monarch who reigns in her own
      right over an "<strong>empire</strong>".

A queen regnant possesses and exercises sovereign powers, whereas a queen consort or queen regent shares her
spouse's and/or child's rank and titles, but does not share the sovereignty of her spouse or child. The husband
or child of a queen regnant traditionally does not share the queen regnant's rank, title or sovereignty. However,
the concept of a king consort or prince consort is not unheard of in both contemporary and classical periods.
A queen dowager or empress dowager is the widow of a king or emperor; a queen mother is a queen dowager who
is also the mother of a reigning sovereign.
